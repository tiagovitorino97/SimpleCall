[size=4][b]What Is It?[/b][/size]
Simple Call lets you [b]call a dealer to come meet you[/b] from the phone. The dealer walks or runs to your location, waits a bit, then goes back to their routine. If you go inside, they'll wait at your last outdoor spot and text you or give up after a set time if you don't come out.
